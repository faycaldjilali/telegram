Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/faycaldjilali/telegram.git
cd telegram
Install Required Libraries: Install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Update Configurations: Replace the placeholder for the Telegram Bot Token in your app.py file:

python
Copy code
TELEGRAM_TOKEN = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
Bot Setup with BotFather
Open Telegram and search for BotFather.
Use /start and then /newbot to create your bot.
Follow the prompts to name your bot and get your Telegram API token.
Store this token securely, as you will use it in your Flask app to authenticate your bot.
Running the Flask Server
Create app.py: The Flask app will handle incoming messages and respond to them. Your app.py file should look something like this:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, request
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

TELEGRAM_TOKEN = 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN'
TELEGRAM_API_URL = f'https://api.telegram.org/bot{TELEGRAM_TOKEN}/sendMessage'

def respond(chat_id, text):
    requests.post(TELEGRAM_API_URL, data={'chat_id': chat_id, 'text': text})

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    data = request.get_json()
    chat_id = data['message']['chat']['id']
    message = data['message']['text']
    
    # AI response logic (use your AI model here)
    response_text = "This is a test response to: " + message
    
    respond(chat_id, response_text)
    return 'ok', 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Run the Flask App:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Exposing the Localhost with ngrok
Download and install ngrok from ngrok.com.

Start ngrok to forward requests to your Flask server:

bash
Copy code
ngrok http 5000
Note down the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abcd1234.ngrok.io).

Set the webhook for your bot using the Telegram API:

bash
Copy code
curl -F "url=https://abcd1234.ngrok.io/webhook" https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook
Testing the Bot
Open Telegram and search for your bot using the name you created via BotFather.
Start a conversation and send a message.
The bot will respond based on the AI model or logic you have set in the app.py file.
